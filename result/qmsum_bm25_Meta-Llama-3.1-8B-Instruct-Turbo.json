The goal is to create a model that combines the decisions of multiple \"experts\" (in this case, the user model, the situation model, and the discourse model) to make a final decision.\n\nThe discussion starts with a suggestion to create a new node in the belief net to represent the endpoint decision, which is based on the user model. However, this creates a problem because the endpoint decision is also influenced by the situation model and the discourse model.\n\nThe group discusses the possibility of using loopy belief propagation, which allows for cycles in the graph, to resolve this issue. They also consider creating an intermediate node that combines the decisions of the user model and the situation model.\n\nThe professor suggests that the goal is to create a weighted combination of the decisions of the individual models, similar to a \"ROVER\" decision, where the outputs of multiple models are combined to make a final decision.\n\nThe group also discusses the need to specify the conditional properties of the belief net, which involves defining the probability of each node given its parents. They also consider the possibility of using discourse properties, such as object properties, to inform the Go-there decision.\n\nThroughout the meeting, the group uses a \"disfmarker\" to indicate where they are unsure or need to add more information. The meeting concludes with a discussion of the next steps, including adding the discourse model and ontology to the belief net.\n\nOverall, the meeting is a collaborative discussion among the group to design a complex probabilistic graphical model that combines the decisions of multiple models to make a final decision.",
