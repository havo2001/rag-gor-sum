The committee members, including Lynne Neagle AM, Sian Gwenllian AM, Dawn Bowden AM, and Barry Hughes, discuss the potential consequences of the proposed law, including its impact on public awareness and the divergence of laws between England and Wales.\n\nBarry Hughes, representing the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, explains that the CPS has a code that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law and will issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise. He also mentions that the CPS is sufficiently flexible to take account of the divergence.\n\nThe committee members raise concerns about the potential consequences of the proposed law, including the impact on life prospects for individuals in Wales who may not be able to use the reasonable punishment defence. They also discuss the need for awareness-raising and guidance to ensure that staff in Wales and England are aware of the divergence in the area of law.\n\nSome key points discussed during the meeting include:\n\n* The proposed law would not provide the same defence in Wales as in England, which could lead to different outcomes for individuals in Wales.\n* The CPS has a code that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law and will issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise.\n* The CPS is sufficiently flexible to take account of the divergence.\n* There is a need for awareness-raising and guidance to ensure that staff in Wales and England are aware of the divergence in the area of law.\n* The committee members discuss the potential for a memorandum of understanding to be established to ensure that the guidance is consistent across both countries.\n\nOverall, the meeting appears to be a discussion of the potential consequences of the proposed law and the need for guidance and awareness-raising to ensure that the law is implemented consistently across both England and Wales.",
        "ground_truth": "This meeting was the eleventh evidence session on the Children Abolition of Defense of Reasonable Publishment Wales Bill. Barry Hughes was there to answer questions related to the Bill. Six main topics that had been discussed or explained. The first one was how the Bill protected the children in terms of prosecutions. The second part explained the divergence between regions and the Bill's implication on England. The third part explained how the law was implemented, and the fourth talked about prosecutions and potential alternatives. Barry Hughes then further explained our-of-court disposals and responded to a specific infrastructure for these cases. In the last part, the meeting turned to discuss a number of unintended consequences related to the Bill.",

Can I thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? You will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. Thank you again for your time in coming here today. Diolch yn fawr.\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: Thank you. It's been a pleasure.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Business Committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the Bill, which has now been agreed. Paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services requesting some further information from CAFCASS Cymru on the Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Minister for Education regarding Diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 July. Are Members happy to note those? Item 4, then. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.",
            " there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. And so, there are issues there in terms of the awareness of members of the public. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. Across the border in Scotland, it drops to 22 \u00b5g. So, the same act\u2014. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 \u00b5g; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. We will issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise. And we think that we are sufficiently flexible",
            " had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on the unintended consequences from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\nSpeaker: Sian Gwenllian AM\nContent: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence.\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: Yes. Okay. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014",
            " is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance.\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that.\nSpeaker: Dawn Bowden AM\nContent: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales\u2014well, and in England, actually, across the border\u2014will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law?\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: Not as of the present",
            " see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this\u2014. If I can give you another example. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have",
            " of the potential divergence of Welsh law. We will issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise. And we think that we are sufficiently flexible to take account of that.\nSpeaker: Dawn Bowden AM\nContent: Okay. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that?\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. There will be a further series of awareness raising. We have strategic implementation groups\u2014Iwan sits on that group. So, we would build ourselves up to come up with the appropriate guidance according to the circumstances. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation"

And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall .

You Yeah . We are playing {disfmarker} we are also playing , trying to put other spectral subtraction mmm , in the code .

        "response": "The meeting appears to be a discussion about designing a belief network for a project. The participants, including Professor B and several graduate students (Grad A, Grad C, Grad D, and Grad E), are working on a system that involves making decisions based on user models, situation models, and discourse models.\n\nThe main topics of discussion include:\n\n1. Designing the belief network: The group is trying to decide how to structure the network, including where to place nodes and how to connect them. They discuss the need for an intermediate node that combines the decisions of the user model and the situation model.\n\n2. Combining decisions: The group wants to combine the decisions of multiple experts (in this case, the user model and the situation model) to make a final decision. They discuss the idea of using a weighted combination of the decisions.\n\n3. Loopy belief propagation: The group mentions the possibility of using loopy belief propagation, which allows for loops in the network.\n\n4. Discourse model: The group discusses the need for a discourse model, which is currently missing from the network. They decide to add a placeholder node for the discourse model.\n\n5. Ontology: The group mentions the need for an ontology, which is also currently missing from the network.\n\nSome specific decisions made during the meeting include:\n\n* Creating a new node to combine the decisions of the user model and the situation model\n* Adding a placeholder node for the discourse model\n* Considering the use of loopy belief propagation\n* Deciding to add an ontology to the network\n\nOverall, the meeting is focused on designing a complex system that involves making decisions based on multiple models and combining those decisions to make a final decision.",
        "ground_truth": "The group members mainly talked about the details of the belief-net framework. They first discussed the way to make the definition of user and situation clear and set up the standards, e.g., user thrift, based on user's budget. Then they turned to the discussion about endpoint decision. They mentioned approaches including setting features/modes of like selling, fixing and exhibiting, and this inspired the group members to design user compatibility nodes of which value would depend on the user status and situation. They further discussed Go-there decision, which is related to the previous idea using the similar set of the ontologies. Finally, they shifted the topic to different probability computation methods for belief-nets and thought of solutions to issues with limited data annotation.",

The meeting involves various members of Parliament presenting petitions, making statements, and asking questions of ministers.\n\nHere's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. The meeting begins with the tabling of documents by Minister Harjit S. Sajjan, including a report on Canada's national action plan for the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions on women, peace, and security.\n\n2. Members of Parliament present petitions, including one from Winnipeg North's Kevin Lamoureux regarding the presidential election in Guyana and another from Saanich-Gulf Islands' Elizabeth May on an unspecified issue.\n\n3. Members make statements, including Paul Lefebvre on the federal government's funding for healthcare in Quebec and Gabriel Ste-Marie on the need for better funding for healthcare in Quebec.\n\n4. Minister Patty Hajdu responds to Ste-Marie's statement, stating that the government has increased transfers to provinces and territories for health services.\n\n5. Members make statements on various issues, including Claude DeBellefeuille's criticism of the Prime Minister's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and Tim Uppal's recognition of the contributions of businesses and organizations in his riding during the pandemic.\n\n6. The meeting concludes with a period of questions for ministers, with the Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Scheer, asking a question about the Prime Minister's refusal to table a budget and provide an economic update.\n\nOverall, the meeting covers a range of topics, including healthcare funding, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Prime Minister's accountability to Canadians.",

The share that the federal government is giving isn't enough. We should act now, before we see a possible second wave. What we're seeing today are the results of massive disinvestment by the federal government in health care. This isn't good enough. The government must act quickly.

However, the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless Prime Minister. First, he locked down Parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition, while the economic recovery must be prepared. He is refusing to provide an economic update, even though the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. We need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic.

However, this topic is quickly abandoned in favor of discussing the project.\n\n2. **Belief Net Project**: The group discusses their project, which involves creating a belief net to analyze data. They mention that they are trying to extract features from the data and that the idea is to not have a node for the entire parse, as they wouldn't do inference on it anyway.\n\n3. **Data Analysis**: They discuss their analysis of the data, which includes people asking about admission fees, directions, and other related topics. They mention that these topics are probabilistically dependent on other factors.\n\n4. **Belief Net Structure**: The group discusses the structure of their belief net, which they haven't fully managed to set up. They mention that they don't have nodes for \"discourse\" and \"parse,\" although they are parts of the belief net.\n\n5. **Probabilities and Learning**: They discuss the challenges of setting up probabilities for their belief net and the potential issues with learning if they move forward with the project.\n\n6. **Switching to Another Program**: One of the participants mentions switching to another program to view the belief net, but it's still in a toy version.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The meeting concludes with a discussion about the initial idea not being very satisfying and the need to revisit the project's approach.\n\nOverall, the meeting appears to be a discussion among researchers working on a project involving a belief net, where they are trying to analyze data and set up a structure for their project.",

        "response": "The meeting appears to be a discussion among researchers about their project, likely related to speech recognition or machine learning. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Noise condition**: The researchers discuss the noise condition in their experiment, noting that it's the same for both training and testing. However, they're still seeing some effect, which is puzzling.\n\n2. **Effect of broader coverage**: Professor B suggests that the effect might be due to the broader coverage of the training data, which is not present in the test data.\n\n3. **Testing on other languages**: The researchers discuss the idea of testing their model on other languages with the same training data to see if the effect persists.\n\n4. **Need for more complexity**: Professor B suggests that the model might not have enough complexity to represent the variability in the training data, which could be the reason for the observed effect.\n\n5. **Comparison of results**: The researchers discuss the results of their experiment, noting that they're similar for different features.\n\n6. **Potential solutions**: The researchers discuss potential solutions, including increasing the number of parameters in the model or using more complex features.\n\n7. **Computational limits**: Professor B mentions the need to consider the computational limits when increasing the number of parameters.\n\n8. **Silence model in HTK**: The researchers discuss the silence model in HTK and how it might be picking up on certain patterns in the data.\n\n9. **Evaluation rules**: Professor B notes that the researchers need to play within the rules of the specific evaluation they're participating in.\n\n10. **Potential issues with reducing information**: PhD D expresses concerns that reducing the amount of information in the model might lead to worse results.\n\nOverall, the meeting appears to be a discussion about the challenges and potential solutions to a specific problem in the researchers' project.",

        "response": "The meeting appears to be a discussion between the Welsh Assembly Members (AMs) and representatives from ColegauCymru (the Welsh Colleges' Federation) regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh Bac). The discussion revolves around several key points:\n\n1. **Status and perception of the Welsh Bac**: The AMs discuss whether introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification would improve the status and perception of the Welsh Bac. Dafydd Evans suggests that contextualizing the Welsh Bac within vocational curricula has been more successful than relying on specialist teachers.\n\n2. **Comparability of the Welsh Bac to other qualifications**: Dafydd Evans notes that the Welsh Bac is a rigorous qualification, but it may be trying to be \"all things to all men.\" This could lead to confusion about its purpose and value.\n\n3. **Preparation for employment**: The AMs discuss how well the Welsh Bac prepares learners for employment. Dafydd Evans suggests that the Welsh Bac may not provide enough difference from the GCSEs learners have already taken, leading to a lack of enthusiasm for the qualification.\n\n4. **Delivery quality and university understanding**: The AMs discuss the variable quality of Welsh Bac delivery in schools and the limited understanding of the Welsh Bac's value among universities, particularly the Russell Group universities.\n\n5. **Skills and employability**: Kay Martin from ColegauCymru emphasizes the importance of the Welsh Bac in developing rounded and employable individuals with a mix of academic and vocational skills.\n\n6. **Comparison with other countries**: Julie Morgan AM mentions a visit to Spain, where they have a more effective entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everyone. This suggests that the Welsh Bac may not be the best product for universal adoption.\n\nThe meeting concludes with the AMs thanking the representatives from ColegauCymru for their time and insights, and they move on to discuss other papers to note.",
        "ground_truth": "This meeting was a Children, Young People and Education Committee, and it was conducted in a question and answer format regarding the inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. They had discussions on whether employers understood the meaning of the Welsh bac and how to actually improve the employer's understanding of the Welsh bac. Then they gave some answers regarding how well the Welsh bac helped to prepare learners for employment. In addition, they had discussions on whether there was a difference in how the Welsh bac was valued by learners at the different levels that it was studied, and to what extent that universities understood the value of the Welsh bac. They also talked about how comparable the Welsh bac was to other qualifications. Then they discussed the idea of universal adoption. Last but not least, they shared some opinions on the necessity of introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification.",

We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden.\nSpeaker: Dawn Bowden AM\nContent: Thank you, Chair. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that?\nSpeaker: Dafydd Evans\nContent: I'm not assured in terms of\u2014yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside\u2014'Welsh bac\u00a0specialists' in inverted commas\u2014it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for",

Right, the next questions are from Julie Morgan.\nSpeaker: Julie Morgan AM\nContent: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that.\nSpeaker: Dafydd Evans\nContent: Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. Actually, it's probably larger than an A-level by now. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up",
            " information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said\u2014that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\u00a0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools\u2014well, and indeed colleges\u2014might be tempted to go for it. So, thank you for that. Diolch.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Okay. Have you finished? Janet.\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: Thank you. Good morning. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective\u2014.\nSpeaker: Dafydd Evans\nContent: I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs\u2014in maths",
            "'ve potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. But I think it's questionable, certainly at national and foundation. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels.\nSpeaker: Dr Rachel Bowen\nContent: And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college.\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: Okay.\u00a0A question, then, just to ColegauCymru: to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh bac?\nSpeaker: Kay Martin\nContent: Well, we don't think they do, really, especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to Russell Group universities. They",
            " at all. I could see that most of the employers\u00a0there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels. We've kind of gone into an university discussion here, but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. The skills that they bring having gone through this process I think most of the employers could get, at least in my sector, they could understand\u2014'I can see what that person can do.' But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. They are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway. So, for me, the Welsh bac helps to build that. Call it something else maybe, but that's what it should do.\nSpeaker: Julie Morgan AM\nContent: Right. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh b",
            " We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the Welsh bac\u00a0is currently. Therefore, I think what we're saying is, if we're going universal adoption, it can't be with this product. This product isn't the product to universally adopt.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Okay, that's interesting. Okay. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering our questions? It's been a very informative and interesting discussion. We will, as usual, send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your time this morning. Okay, item 3, then, is papers to note.

        "response": "The meeting appears to be a discussion between the Welsh Government and members of the National Assembly for Wales regarding the new curriculum reform in Wales. The main topics of discussion include:\n\n1. **Embedding human rights in the new curriculum**: Kirsty Williams AM, the Minister for Education, explained that children's rights and human rights have been key considerations throughout the design of the new curriculum. The Children's Commissioner's office has been working with the government to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience.\n\n2. **Concerns about consultation materials for young people**: Janet Finch-Saunders AM raised concerns that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid-June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage. Kirsty Williams AM acknowledged the concern and stated that the government is using this feedback to inform decisions going forward.\n\n3. **Consistency and accountability in the new curriculum**: Hefin David AM expressed concerns about the lack of consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered, which could affect outcomes. Kirsty Williams AM explained that the government is changing its approach to the legislation to ensure that progression steps are the same wherever you are in Wales.\n\n4. **Accountability framework**: Suzy Davies AM asked about the expected changes to the accountability framework. Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that the government is moving towards a balanced paper that looks at pros and cons, and that there will be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly.\n\n5. **Segregation within schools**: Kirsty Williams AM responded to concerns that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils. She stated that there is no evidence to suggest that this will happen, but that the government needs to consider these concerns as it plans the new curriculum.\n\n6. **Governance and pupil referral units**: Kirsty Williams AM confirmed that the governance set-up will remain the same, and that there are no changes being made to the different groups. She also explained that the government has been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, to ensure that pupil referral units can benefit from the new curriculum.\n\n7. **Legislation and primary aspects**: Sian Gwenllian AM asked about the specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum that will be included in the primary legislation. Kirsty Williams AM explained that the original proposal was to provide for the four purposes and the areas of learning and experience in the legislation, as well as legislating for some cross-curricular aspects, such as literacy, numeracy, and digital competency.",

Also, the spirit of co-construction was also included and the four purposes would ensure the legitimacy of changes. Besides,  'what matters' were the articulation of the big ideas and although there were significant differences between each sector, they act following the same guidance.

And I'm delighted that the children's commissioner took the time to write to me during the feedback phase to say that they were very pleased that their initial assessment demonstrates that what we're proposing is a big step forward.\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: Thank you.

            "Speaker: Hefin David AM\nContent: So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'.\nSpeaker: Kirsty Williams AM\nContent: Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again.

            " this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive\u2014inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes. We only have to look at the debacle around BTEC science to know that.\nSpeaker: Suzy Davies AM\nContent: Okay. I understand that. So, how\u2014? Can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability, on both sides of that thick black line\u2014the methodology\u2014is likely to change with this? You mentioned that there's going to be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly; we know that some of the existing ones have been ditched in fairly recent legislation. Without pre-empting the findings of such a review, have you got your top three likely expected changes?\nSpeaker: Kirsty Williams AM\nContent: To accountability?\nSpeaker: Suzy Davies AM\nContent: Yes.\nSpeaker: Kirsty Williams AM\nContent: To accountability.

How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils?\nSpeaker: Kirsty Williams AM\nContent: Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant",

And just finally from me, then, on pupil referral units: what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation?\nSpeaker: Kirsty Williams AM\nContent: Okay. So, we've been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, and this has been an area where we've had to think really, really, really, really, really hard. So, what we intend to do for EOTAS and PRU is to set a minimum of what we would expect a child to receive. So, that would be around the four purposes; that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. So, that would be the baseline of our expectation, that every pupil would get that. After",

We want to know what those aspects will be and what has made you change your mind.\nSpeaker: Kirsty Williams AM\nContent: The original proposal that we began working on was, in the legislation, to provide for the four purposes\u2014so, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation\u2014as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects\u2014so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency\u2014as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports.

They realize that for summarization tasks, the distant microphone may not be necessary, and the close microphone may also not be essential.\n\n5. **Transcript Modification**: The group discusses the issue of modifying transcripts to remove names or other identifying information. They decide that it's not necessary to change the names in the transcript, as it would be misleading and artificial.\n\nOverall, the meeting focuses on discussing the group's data collection and analysis plans, as well as addressing technical and methodological issues related to their research.",

And that way we",
            " about some {pause} new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to {pause} listen to .

I have to meet with , uh , Stephane to do that .

The team discussed the project's objective, which is to create a universal remote control that can work with multiple TVs. However, the Industrial Designer mentioned that the current design involves a chip that produces patterns to identify the buttons pressed, which seems to be a complex approach.\n\n2. The User Interface team member presented their part of the project, which included functional requirements and a discussion about the product's design. However, the presentation was cut short due to technical issues.\n\n3. The Industrial Designer then presented their design, which involved using a chip to produce patterns to identify the buttons pressed. They explained that the chip sends a Morse code-like signal to the LED, which then controls the TV.\n\n4. The team discussed the technical aspects of the design, including the use of a chip to produce patterns and the need to get the patterns right to make the remote control work.\n\n5.

Industrial Designer presented the prototype as a clam-shell design with a flip-top LCD touch screen and fully closed flat buttons at the bottom. There would be a wide choice of colours and patterns due to customization. Inside the remote control, there would be a standard chip and a kinetic battery. The team was under the budget at present. Once the budget increased, however, the voice recognition would be incorporated. The remote control's fashion style and location function were most highly rated among the team members, but the minimization of repetitive strain injury was not satisfying enough.

The discussion centered around supporting students with additional learning needs, particularly those who have experienced early trauma and adversity. \n\nKey points discussed during the meeting include:\n\n1. Transition arrangements for students moving from a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) to mainstream education were highlighted as a challenge, with some students struggling to reintegrate into school settings.\n\n2. The importance of schools being inclusive and providing opportunities for students with additional learning needs to progress was emphasized.\n\n3. The impact of early trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on students' mental health and well-being was discussed, with a focus on the need for schools to adapt their practices to take account of these issues.\n\n4. The connection between early trauma, loneliness, and isolation was highlighted, with research suggesting that these factors can contribute to lifelong isolation and increased risk of suicidal ideation.\n\n5. The need for a continuum of provision and support for learners was emphasized, with a focus on collaborative working between schools, PRUs, and local authorities.\n\n6. The importance of professional learning and training for staff in PRUs and schools was discussed, with a focus on equipping them with the skills and knowledge to support students with additional learning needs.\n\n7. The Gwent attachment team's work with PRUs in Gwent was highlighted as a positive example of supporting staff and embedding awareness of attachment and early trauma in PRUs.\n\n8. The need for further research and investigation into the impact of early trauma and ACEs on students' mental health and well-being was emphasized.\n\n9. The importance of addressing the transport issue affecting students with additional learning needs was also mentioned.\n\nThe meeting concluded with the committee thanking the witnesses for their attendance and indicating that they would write to them about some of the areas discussed during the session.",

The increase brought more pressure to EOTAS in the aspects of finance, transition, curriculum arrangement and the recruitment of professional staff. Although much time and finance had been devoted to the PRU, the education quality could still not be assured. The collaboration between the PRU and the schools required to be strengthened. Besides, training for special education ought to be included in teachers' colleges to meet EOTAS learners' special needs. Their psychological health was another concerning problem.",

But in the past, there might well have been some staff who perhaps hadn't had those school experiences and vice versa.\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: Can I just ask you about transition arrangements, because I know some of the issues that have arisen in my own constituency is when a pupil is in a PRU and then trying to get back into mainstream education? It isn't a clear, sort of, going from one to the other\u2014sometimes a child can find themselves at home because they're not able to get back into the school setting, the main school setting.

And, then, to what extent are schools aware of the impact of early trauma ACEs, and how are schools adapting their practices to take account of them?\nSpeaker: Dr Ian Johnson\nContent: I don't think we're really capable of saying that on an individual level. We're aware, as you've heard from previous evidence from heads of education, et cetera, directors of education, that work is going on on an all-Wales basis, and there's obviously an awful lot of work that's going on on the ACEs agenda. I referred to being a previous school governor, and that's somewhere that's become a trauma-informed school, and they have established that and are widening that base. I think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back, as I said, with the curriculum changes as we're",
            " Sarah Stone\nContent: And I think, just to add to that around the impact of early trauma, I think one of the things that we at Samaritans are particularly aware of is the impact of loneliness and isolation on individuals and how that can help to drive distress and suicidal ideation. That sense of belongingness is recognised by the research as being critical to functioning well as a human being. We are social beings. And one of the ways in which early trauma and adversity, if that leads to exclusion from a range of groups, is to lead to lifelong isolation. It's something that comes out when you look at middle-aged men. You look at a trajectory that goes back towards their early years, very often, and Samaritans is about to release some research on that very point. So, there's a connection between what happens in later life and what happens here. There's also, if we look at the numbers of exclusions around boys, and we're looking at much higher suicide rates and numbers of other issues around men\u2014. Again, I think it's important to see this whole picture\u2014\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: It's very bad in north Wales. Our figures are very worrying.\nSpeaker: Sarah Stone",

I just wanted to ask, then, the Gwent attachment team has been working with PRUs in Gwent, and the committee is familiar with the work of the Gwent attachment team, can you just tell us what you think the impact of that has been in terms of support for staff and embedding that awareness of attachment and early trauma in the PRUs?\nSpeaker: Sharon Davies\nContent: I think any form of professional learning, it's positive, and, therefore, as we alluded to earlier, it's that expertise training for the PRU then and for the staff there.

What more can be done, and by whom, to support collaborative working between schools,\u00a0PRUs and local authorities to ensure that there is a continuum of provision and support for learners?\nSpeaker: Nick Williams\nContent: Well, one of the things I think that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector. We meet on a regular basis, and that's nationally. And the EOTAS group meets regionally as well. So, there's definitely a better sharing of practice. We put on some very, very good conferences as one form of professional learning. But it's also important\u2014.

The project manager mentioned that the top goal of the meeting is to reach a decision on the product, target group, and functions of the remote control.\n\n2. The project manager stated that the remote control should not support teletext, as the company's board feels that teletext is outdated and internet is replacing it.\n\n3. The project manager mentioned that the remote control should only be used for television, as it's not feasible to implement other functions.\n\n4.

The project manager agreed that a simple design with fewer buttons would be a good approach, but emphasized that the remote control should still be user-friendly and trendy.\n\n6. The user interface designer suggested that the remote control could have a combination of functions, but without teletext buttons, which would reduce the number of buttons to around 8.\n\n7.

Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to substitute voice recognition for the ten digits.

Grad C mentions that it would be helpful to have an example from their domain, and the conversation continues with a discussion about the work being done at MPI in Leipzig and its relation to the thesis proposal.\n\nOverall, the meeting seems to be a casual discussion between the graduate student and their professor, with the conversation meandering between different topics.",
        "ground_truth": "The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy. Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context. Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: \"walk/run into\", \"on the bus\", \"out of film\", \"where is X?\". However, none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich.",

The larger companies have sent contractors home and laid off employees. Many of these contractors are indigenous companies, and they are having a difficult time qualifying for programs to save their businesses.

Therefore, we are looking after workers and we are looking out for companies that hold onto those jobs for those workers.\nSpeaker: Mr. David Yurdiga\nContent: Mr. Chair, the government's assistance package for the Canadian oil and gas industry provides some hope to the industry. The lack of detail and action has led to some challenges. Can the minister clarify? On a medium-sized energy company's eligibility, if the company is in default to financial institutions, does it still qualify for the business credit availability program?\nSpeaker: Hon. Seamus O'Regan\nContent: Mr. Chair, we know that our oil and gas sector is suffering through two crises. We have the impacts of COVID and the effects of a global price war, and we have been tackling both of these on each front. On April 17, we announced liquidity measures to support the small and medium-sized players. That made up 85% of the jobs in this sector. We have announced",

COVID-19 didn't cause the problems; it exposed them. Decades of neglect by governments at all levels have resulted in this calamity. Not a single province or territory in Canada is meeting the minimum standards of hands-on care for seniors, and death rates from COVID-19 in private, for-profit facilities are two to three times that of public or non-profit homes.

The attendees include the Project Manager, User Interface Designer (David Jordan), Industrial Designer, and Marketing representative. \n\nHere's a summary of the meeting:\n\n1. The meeting starts with a discussion about a remote control prototype, which will remain a prototype. The Project Manager suggests moving on to a detailed design meeting.\n\n2. The User Interface Designer, David Jordan, presents the project, including its design, which is called the \"mushroom design\" due to its resemblance to a mushroom. The design features a yellow and red color scheme, with a fuzzy texture.\n\n3. The attendees discuss the production cost of the remote control, with the goal of keeping it under 12.50 Euros. If the cost is not met, the design will need to be revised.\n\n4. The User Interface Designer presents several key features of the prototype, including its fuzzy design, which is intended to be unique in the market.\n\n5. The attendees agree that the design and evaluation of the remote control are complete, and they have a nearly final product.\n\n6. The Project Manager thanks the attendees for their participation and notes that the meeting was productive.\n\n7. The Industrial Designer suggests that the attendees discuss the production of the remote control, and the User Interface Designer offers to present slides to facilitate the discussion.\n\n8.

Next, the marketing suggested doing some product evaluation instead of just talking about it, so the group started to judge the design in three aspects: how fancy, technologically innovative, and easy-to-use the remote control was. It got three, two, and four in separate aspects, which meant the design was acceptable. Later, the group discussed the quotation and made some decisions on details of industrial design to make sure the cost was within the budget. Furthermore, they came up with some new ideas about future products, such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable TV that followed the trend and people's moods. Finally, the group named the product as pineapple remote control.",
