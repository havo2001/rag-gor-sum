        "response": "The meeting appears to be a committee meeting, likely in the Welsh Government or a related organization, discussing a proposed new law related to child protection. The committee members, Lynne Neagle AM, Sian Gwenllian AM, and Suzy Davies AM, are questioning Barry Hughes, a representative, about the proposed law.\n\nThe discussion revolves around the potential impact of the law, including:\n\n1. The likelihood of prosecutions: Barry Hughes and Lynne Neagle AM discuss the low number of prosecutions that are likely to occur under the proposed law, citing a 2007 review that found only 12 cases in a two-year period.\n2. Unintended consequences: Sian Gwenllian AM raises concerns about the potential for malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases, and the risk of people being pushed through the criminal justice system inappropriately to meet performance targets.\n3. Barriers to implementation: Barry Hughes addresses the potential barrier of a shortage of registered intermediaries to assist child witnesses, but notes that this is being addressed and that the numbers of cases are likely to be low, making it manageable.\n\nOverall, the meeting is a thorough discussion of the proposed law and its potential implications, with a focus on ensuring that the law is effective in protecting children while minimizing any potential negative consequences.",
        "ground_truth": "This meeting was the eleventh evidence session on the Children Abolition of Defense of Reasonable Publishment Wales Bill. Barry Hughes was there to answer questions related to the Bill. Six main topics that had been discussed or explained. The first one was how the Bill protected the children in terms of prosecutions. The second part explained the divergence between regions and the Bill's implication on England. The third part explained how the law was implemented, and the fourth talked about prosecutions and potential alternatives. Barry Hughes then further explained our-of-court disposals and responded to a specific infrastructure for these cases. In the last part, the meeting turned to discuss a number of unintended consequences related to the Bill.",

It's been a pleasure.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Business Committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the Bill, which has now been agreed. Paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services requesting some further information from CAFCASS Cymru on the Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Minister for Education regarding Diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 July. Are Members happy to note those? Item 4, then.

            " new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question.\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: I can attempt an answer. I follow entirely where you're going. I agree, the chances are pretty low, but they're greater than they are presently. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children.\nSpeaker: Suzy Davies AM\nContent: Okay, that's really helpful, thank you.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Before we move on, can I just ask\u2014? The Children",
            " that reached double figures on these cases. They're likely to be very limited. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest.\nSpeaker: Sian Gwenllian AM\nContent: Thank you for that. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance",
            " impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. If that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. So, you're talking small numbers. Now, small numbers\u2014and we might not have any. Okay? It depends. Obviously, if there's a really good awareness-raising campaign, you make it less likely. And, for us, prosecution\u2014it's not the first port of call here at all. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever\u201412, 18 months, maybe 24 months\u2014",
            " down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. That disappeared some years ago. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. The police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. It's much less of an issue than it ever was\u2014much.\nSpeaker: Sian Gwenllian AM\nContent: Okay. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. This happens now, of course. Is that going to increase if we change the law?\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Regrettably, there are times when children are used",
            " who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise?\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: No. It's a potential barrier, but I don't think it is a barrier. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier. I think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. I've got no significant concerns, I have to say.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Thank you. Well, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers,"

Then they turned to the discussion about endpoint decision. They mentioned approaches including setting features/modes of like selling, fixing and exhibiting, and this inspired the group members to design user compatibility nodes of which value would depend on the user status and situation. They further discussed Go-there decision, which is related to the previous idea using the similar set of the ontologies.

The idea of segmenting off different regions in the model and creating observable \"nodes\" or features.\n3. The possibility of using the model to make inferences about discourse phenomena, such as the admission fee and other events that occurred in the discourse.\n4. The idea of creating a separate region of the net with its own middle layer and hidden nodes.\n5. The possibility of doing a demo to observe the fact that the model can do inference.\n6. The discussion of data collection, including interviewing a subject (Fey) and recruiting other subjects for the study.\n\nSome key points from the meeting include:\n\n* The students are still refining their understanding of the \"belief-net\" concept and how it can be applied to discourse analysis.\n* They are working on creating a model that can make inferences about discourse phenomena.\n* They are planning to do a demo to test the model's ability to do inference.\n* They are discussing data collection and have identified a subject (Fey) who is willing to participate in the study.\n\nOverall, the meeting appears to be a brainstorming session where the students are discussing their ideas and refining their understanding of the project.",

It is possible for these variables to form thematic clusters( eg \"entrance\", \"type of object\", \"verb\"), each one with a separate middle layer.

        "response": "The meeting appears to be a discussion between researchers, specifically PhD students and a professor, about a project related to speech recognition and machine learning. The main topics discussed are:\n\n1. **Language and Training Data**: The researchers are comparing the performance of a speech recognition system when trained on one language versus multiple languages. They discuss the idea of using a broad coverage of languages for training and testing, but note that this can lead to issues with getting enough training data for specific contexts.\n\n2. **Error Rates**: The researchers mention that when using the same language for training and testing, the error rate is around 1.1, while using multiple languages (broad data) results in an error rate of around 1.3.\n\n3. **Neural Network and HTK**: The discussion turns to the choice of tools for the project, with the professor suggesting that they use a neural network, but also mentioning the HTK system. They discuss the pros and cons of each option and the potential time required for training and decoding.\n\n4. **Context and Acoustics**: The professor notes that incorporating context into the system can lead to better scores, but it's a complex task to get this right. They also discuss the issue of representing more and more context, which can be specific to a particular task and language.\n\nOverall, the meeting is a discussion about the challenges and opportunities of using machine learning and speech recognition techniques for a project involving multiple languages.",
        "ground_truth": "The participants discussed results from the experiments that had been conducted. Switching between tasks in the same language had smaller errors than multilingual models. The professor thought that increasing the parameters of the net for larger multi-lingual models would be helpful.

        "response": "The meeting appears to be a discussion between the Welsh Government and various stakeholders, including ColegauCymru (the Welsh Colleges' Federation), regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh Bac). The main topics of discussion include:\n\n1. The effectiveness of the Welsh Bac in preparing learners for employment: Dafydd Evans from ColegauCymru expressed concerns that the Welsh Bac is not well understood by employers and that it may not be providing the skills that they require.\n\n2. The challenges of implementing the Welsh Bac: Nick Brazil from ColegauCymru mentioned that the Welsh Bac has become a rigorous qualification, which may not be suitable for all learners. He also highlighted the issue of prioritizing GCSE resits over the Welsh Bac, particularly at levels 1 and 2.\n\n3. The use of the Welsh Bac as a recruitment tool: Kay Martin from ColegauCymru stated that the Welsh Bac is not used as a recruitment tool in most colleges across Wales, as it is valued and seen as an important part of the curriculum.\n\n4. The vision and purpose of the Welsh Bac: The meeting also touched on the original vision of the Welsh Bac, which was to provide a qualification that would be equivalent to a Duke of Edinburgh award. However, it seems that the Welsh Bac has evolved into a more rigorous qualification, which may not be meeting the original goals.\n\nOverall, the meeting appears to be a discussion about the challenges and limitations of the Welsh Bac, as well as the need for changes and improvements to make it more effective in preparing learners for employment and meeting the needs of employers.",
        "ground_truth": "This meeting was a Children, Young People and Education Committee, and it was conducted in a question and answer format regarding the inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. They had discussions on whether employers understood the meaning of the Welsh bac and how to actually improve the employer's understanding of the Welsh bac. Then they gave some answers regarding how well the Welsh bac helped to prepare learners for employment. In addition, they had discussions on whether there was a difference in how the Welsh bac was valued by learners at the different levels that it was studied, and to what extent that universities understood the value of the Welsh bac. They also talked about how comparable the Welsh bac was to other qualifications. Then they discussed the idea of universal adoption. Last but not least, they shared some opinions on the necessity of introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification.",

            " information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said\u2014that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\u00a0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools\u2014well, and indeed colleges\u2014might be tempted to go for it. So, thank you for that. Diolch.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Okay. Have you finished? Janet.\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: Thank you. Good morning. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective\u2014.\nSpeaker: Dafydd Evans\nContent: I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs\u2014in maths",
            " We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the Welsh bac\u00a0is currently. Therefore, I think what we're saying is, if we're going universal adoption, it can't be with this product. This product isn't the product to universally adopt.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Okay, that's interesting. Okay. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering our questions? It's been a very informative and interesting discussion. We will, as usual, send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your time this morning. Okay, item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, paper to note 2 is the letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales on home education, and paper to note 3 is the letter that the Cabinet Secretary for Education has sent to us in reply to our letter about free school meals. Are Members happy to",
            " able to join us. If it's okay with you, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\nSpeaker: Sian Gwenllian AM\nContent: Good morning. I'll be asking my questions in Welsh.\nSpeaker: Dafydd Evans\nContent: Could I start and then open it up? Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru\u00a0would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac\u00a0there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. We've possibly chosen this panel because there are differences of opinion. So, I just want to give you that context at the outset. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac\u00a0means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac\u00a0is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I",
            "businesses. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine.\nSpeaker: Nick Brazil\nContent: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues\u00a0within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly\u00a0meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bac\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within\u00a0those professional sectors. Not many of them have indicated that the Welsh bac is providing the skills that they require. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac\u00a0initially, but the Welsh bac\u00a0has turned into quite a rigorous, some",
            " the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs\u2014in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a\u00a0C grade in the core subjects. But that eats into the time that we have to teach young people. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow\u2014no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. So, the priorities, I think, across the sector\u2014. We've given priority to GCSE\u00a0resits\u00a0rather than doing the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3.\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker: Nick Brazil\nContent: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh b",

We don't say, 'Come to us and you don't have to do the Welsh bac,' because if they do A-levels, we say it's compulsory, unless you're in the Seren group.\nSpeaker: Suzy Davies AM\nContent: Yes. Well, that's the point; it's about English-speaking students, not just Welsh\u2014.\nSpeaker: Kay Martin\nContent: No, it isn't used. In the majority of colleges across Wales, it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool, because most of us, as you see, we value the Welsh bac. We'd like some changes to the Welsh bac, but we value the Welsh bac\u00a0in many cases. So, we wouldn't deliberately\u2014. I mean, if a course in my college doesn't want to do the Welsh bac, they have to come and give me evidence about why they don't think it's fit and what they're going to do in place of it. So, we don't deliberately tell"

Embedding human rights and children's rights in the new curriculum: Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that children's rights and human rights have been key considerations throughout the design of the new curriculum, and that the children's commissioner's office is working with the Welsh Government to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience.\n\n2. Qualifications Wales' national conversation on reform of qualifications: Qualifications Wales will begin their national conversation on reform of qualifications as a result of curriculum reform in November, which will allow for the development of qualifications that are properly aligned with the new curriculum.\n\n3. Timeline for implementation: The new curriculum is expected to be implemented in 2022, with the actual curriculum being released in January 2022, and the process for underpinning it to be completed afterwards.\n\n4. Potential unintended consequences: The committee discussed potential unintended consequences of the new curriculum, including the need to make a distinction between assessment for learning and accountability in the system.\n\n5. Accountability: Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that the Welsh Government is moving towards a more nuanced approach to accountability, with an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly. She also mentioned that the existing accountability measures have been ditched in recent legislation.\n\n6. EOTAS (Education Other Than At School): The committee mentioned that they will be looking into EOTAS in a future inquiry, and that they will build on the discussion about the need for an appropriate addition to meet the needs of children who require additional support.\n\nOverall, the meeting was a thorough discussion of the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales, and the potential implications and challenges associated with its implementation.",

Also, the spirit of co-construction was also included and the four purposes would ensure the legitimacy of changes. Besides,  'what matters' were the articulation of the big ideas and although there were significant differences between each sector, they act following the same guidance.

That's really helpful.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Okay, as my colleague Chair Dai Lloyd would say, 'Now we're into the needing serious agility territory'. So, we've got some questions on specific areas. Firstly from me: Qualifications Wales have told us that the curriculum must define qualifications rather than the other way around. What implications does that have for the amount of time that is needed to develop qualifications that are properly aligned with the new curriculum?\nSpeaker: Kirsty Williams AM\nContent: Well, I'd absolutely agree with Qualifications Wales. The qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum, and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum.

The need for portable equipment to make the recording process easier when recording meetings outside of ICSI.\n\nOverall, the meeting is focused on managing the Meeting Recorder project, discussing solutions to space issues, and exploring new possibilities for the project.",
        "ground_truth": "In this meeting, the speakers addressed issues that related to their meeting annotation progress. They talked about the types and variability of the future meetings. This led to them speaking about how to use their recording equipment if they got groups outside of their own departments to record meetings. Additionally, they discussed how to handle the storage of meetings on disk. They eventually address how to handle speech overlap and speaker anonymity, which were two crucial issues.",

The increase brought more pressure to EOTAS in the aspects of finance, transition, curriculum arrangement and the recruitment of professional staff. Although much time and finance had been devoted to the PRU, the education quality could still not be assured. The collaboration between the PRU and the schools required to be strengthened. Besides, training for special education ought to be included in teachers' colleges to meet EOTAS learners' special needs. Their psychological health was another concerning problem.",

What more can be done, and by whom, to support collaborative working between schools,\u00a0PRUs and local authorities to ensure that there is a continuum of provision and support for learners?\nSpeaker: Nick Williams\nContent: Well, one of the things I think that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector. We meet on a regular basis, and that's nationally. And the EOTAS group meets regionally as well. So, there's definitely a better sharing of practice. We put on some very, very good conferences as one form of professional learning. But it's also important\u2014.

And, then, to what extent are schools aware of the impact of early trauma ACEs, and how are schools adapting their practices to take account of them?\nSpeaker: Dr Ian Johnson\nContent: I don't think we're really capable of saying that on an individual level. We're aware, as you've heard from previous evidence from heads of education, et cetera, directors of education, that work is going on on an all-Wales basis, and there's obviously an awful lot of work that's going on on the ACEs agenda. I referred to being a previous school governor, and that's somewhere that's become a trauma-informed school, and they have established that and are widening that base. I think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back, as I said, with the curriculum changes as we're",

But in the past, there might well have been some staff who perhaps hadn't had those school experiences and vice versa.\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: Can I just ask you about transition arrangements, because I know some of the issues that have arisen in my own constituency is when a pupil is in a PRU and then trying to get back into mainstream education?

I think that is something that, perhaps, slightly concerns me about the whole field is not being able to get a national feel for these issues. I would suspect that there are pockets of very good practice.

        "ground_truth": "The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy. Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context. Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: \"walk/run into\", \"on the bus\", \"out of film\", \"where is X?\". However, none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich.",

The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects \u2014material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with LCD, applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation, and using low level chips, which was agreed by the group. The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel and the product should be technologically innovative.

I have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of Don Valley East. The petitioners are asking that the Government of Canada not provide any financial assistance to Canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to COVID-19. They are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to, within or from Canada.

Patty Hajdu\nContent: Mr. Chair, certainly the member of Parliament has made an assertion that there is finger pointing. I don't think that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, what I hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how, first of all, we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes.\nSpeaker: Mr. Don Davies\nContent: Mr. Chair, what I'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take, but let me move to another subject. Like long-term care, COVID-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system. Millions of Canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs, revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status.

COVID-19 didn't cause the problems; it exposed them. Decades of neglect by governments at all levels have resulted in this calamity. Not a single province or territory in Canada is meeting the minimum standards of hands-on care for seniors, and death rates from COVID-19 in private, for-profit facilities are two to three times that of public or non-profit homes.

The attendees include a Project Manager, a Marketing representative, a User Interface designer, and an Industrial Designer. \n\nThe meeting starts with a discussion about the final prototype of the remote control, which is nearly complete. The team agrees that they have finished designing and evaluating the product. The Project Manager thanks the team for their productive meeting.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to the cost of the product, with the Project Manager mentioning that the target price is 12.50 Euros. The team discusses the production cost and the need to ensure that the final product does not exceed this price.\n\nThe Industrial Designer mentions that the product has a solar panel to compensate for its \"sleeping\" nature, which is likely a reference to the product's ability to recharge itself using solar power. The team also discusses the number of buttons on the remote control, with the Industrial Designer suggesting that three buttons are sufficient.\n\nThe meeting concludes with the Project Manager stating that the costs are within the budget and that the team can celebrate their creation. The User Interface designer also thanks the Project Manager for his leadership, and the meeting ends with a positive note.\n\nOverall, the meeting was a productive discussion about the final stages of the remote control project, with the team addressing key issues such as cost, design, and functionality.",

Next, the marketing suggested doing some product evaluation instead of just talking about it, so the group started to judge the design in three aspects: how fancy, technologically innovative, and easy-to-use the remote control was. It got three, two, and four in separate aspects, which meant the design was acceptable. Later, the group discussed the quotation and made some decisions on details of industrial design to make sure the cost was within the budget. Furthermore, they came up with some new ideas about future products, such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable TV that followed the trend and people's moods. Finally, the group named the product as pineapple remote control.",

Standard features such as sorting through channels and adjusting volume would not lose their priority. The team, therefore, agreed on a style of basic buttons with a self-intuitive screen menu.
