The committee members present were Lynne Neagle, Vikki Howells, and Dawn Bowden, along with the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales, Barry Hughes, and other officials from the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nThe discussion began with Barry Hughes explaining the work being done by the National Police Chiefs' Council to simplify the range of out-of-court disposals. He also clarified the role of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in dealing with cases that are referred to them for a charging decision.\n\nThe committee members then asked questions about the proposed law, including its potential impact on life prospects for individuals in Wales who would no longer be able to use the reasonable punishment defence. Barry Hughes acknowledged that this could be a concern and that the CPS in England would need to be aware of the changes, although not to the same extent as in Wales.\n\nThe discussion also touched on cross-border issues that may arise from the potential legislation. Barry Hughes stated that, apart from the divergence of criminal law, there were no significant cross-border issues. He also mentioned that officials from both sides had been engaging with each other to discuss the implications of the legislation.\n\nOverall, the meeting was a discussion of the potential implications of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill and the role of the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales.",
        "ground_truth": "This meeting was the eleventh evidence session on the Children Abolition of Defense of Reasonable Publishment Wales Bill. Barry Hughes was there to answer questions related to the Bill. Six main topics that had been discussed or explained. The first one was how the Bill protected the children in terms of prosecutions. The second part explained the divergence between regions and the Bill's implication on England. The third part explained how the law was implemented, and the fourth talked about prosecutions and potential alternatives. Barry Hughes then further explained our-of-court disposals and responded to a specific infrastructure for these cases. In the last part, the meeting turned to discuss a number of unintended consequences related to the Bill.",

            " tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option?\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. Their lead is deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. Any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something\u2014. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very",
            " will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. Does that help?\nSpeaker: Vikki Howells AM",
            "Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and Jack Sargeant. Vikki Howells is substituting for Jack Sargeant. So, Vikki, welcome; it's good to see you in the committee. Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. So thank you all for attending this afternoon. We're really looking forward to hearing your views on the Bill. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: Perfectly happy.\nSpeaker: Sian Gwenllian AM\nContent: Thank you very much. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands",
            " had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on the unintended consequences from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\nSpeaker: Sian Gwenllian AM\nContent: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence.\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: Yes. Okay. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014",
            " AM\nContent: Okay. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes?\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. We have regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law.\nSpeaker: Dawn Bowden AM\nContent: That's helpful, thank you. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation.\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: In addition to those that I've mentioned, probably not. It boils down to the fact that there's a",
            "aker: Dawn Bowden AM\nContent: Or the service's.\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: Iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on a more routine basis. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister\u2014I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago\u2014to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation.\nSpeaker: Dawn Bowden AM\nContent: Okay. So you've been satisfied with the level of involvement that you've had.\nSpeaker: Barry Hughes\nContent: Yes. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all.\nSpeaker: Dawn Bowden AM\nContent: Okay. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we,"

Creating a new node to represent the endpoint decision as seen from the user model, ontology, and discourse.\n3. Deciding on a name for the new node, with Professor B suggesting \"endpoint underbar-U\" (e.g., endpoint_U).\n4. Discussing the need for data with people's intentions and how to obtain it.\n5. Considering how to merge three separate endpoint decisions into one.\n\nSome key points from the meeting include:\n\n- The group is working on a system that involves user models, ontology, and discourse.\n- They need to create an intermediate node for the endpoint decision, which will be based on these three components.\n- The group is struggling to decide on a name for the new node and how to represent it in the system.\n- They are also discussing the need for data with people's intentions and how to obtain it.\n- The group is considering merging three separate endpoint decisions into one.\n\nOverall, the meeting seems to be a brainstorming session where the group is trying to design a system that incorporates multiple components and is struggling to decide on some of the details.",

They first discussed the way to make the definition of user and situation clear and set up the standards, e.g., user thrift, based on user's budget. Then they turned to the discussion about endpoint decision. They mentioned approaches including setting features/modes of like selling, fixing and exhibiting, and this inspired the group members to design user compatibility nodes of which value would depend on the user status and situation. They further discussed Go-there decision, which is related to the previous idea using the similar set of the ontologies. Finally, they shifted the topic to different probability computation methods for belief-nets and thought of solutions to issues with limited data annotation.",

        "response": "The meeting appears to be a discussion between Professor B and PhD students D, E, and F about a project involving language processing and neural networks. The main topics of discussion include:\n\n1. The results of the project, which show similar performance for different features or languages.\n2. The issue of training on a single language and testing on another language, which seems to be a problem.\n3. The size of the training data, which is two times larger than the broad English data, but includes the broad English data.\n4. The word error rate for the same language but using different training data, which is around 1.1.\n5. The use of the LDA filter, which needs a training set to obtain the filter, and whether it is obtained with its own training set for each language.\n\nThe main question being discussed is whether training on one language but having a broad coverage and then testing in another language improves things in comparison. The discussion suggests that this may not be the case, as training on TIMIT and testing on Italian digits, for example, may not perform well.\n\nOverall, the meeting appears to be a discussion about the results of the project and the challenges and limitations of the current approach.",

        "response": "The meeting appears to be a discussion about the Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh Bac) qualification, its effectiveness, and its value to learners. The meeting is attended by various stakeholders, including politicians and representatives from ColegauCymru (the Welsh colleges' organization).\n\nThe discussion revolves around several key points:\n\n1. **Employer buy-in**: Dafydd Evans suggests that employers should have a greater role in shaping the Welsh Bac qualification to ensure it meets their needs and improves employability skills.\n2. **Learner experience**: Sian Gwenllian AM raises concerns that learners may have had a negative experience with the Welsh Bac in previous studies, which could impact its value.\n3. **Employer understanding**: Dafydd Evans states that employers do not have a clear understanding of what the Welsh Bac means or what it includes, which may contribute to its lack of recognition.\n4. **Comparability to other qualifications**: The discussion touches on the issue of whether the Welsh Bac is comparable to other qualifications, such as A-levels. Dafydd Evans suggests that the Welsh Bac is trying to be \"all things to all men,\" which may dilute its effectiveness.\n5. **Training and delivery**: The meeting explores the idea of introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh Bac. Dafydd Evans suggests that this may not be the most effective approach, as the qualification has been more successful when vocational lecturers have taken it on board and contextualized it within their subject area.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the Welsh Bac qualification and its value to learners, as well as the importance of employer buy-in and contextualization to improve its effectiveness.",
        "ground_truth": "This meeting was a Children, Young People and Education Committee, and it was conducted in a question and answer format regarding the inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. They had discussions on whether employers understood the meaning of the Welsh bac and how to actually improve the employer's understanding of the Welsh bac. Then they gave some answers regarding how well the Welsh bac helped to prepare learners for employment. In addition, they had discussions on whether there was a difference in how the Welsh bac was valued by learners at the different levels that it was studied, and to what extent that universities understood the value of the Welsh bac. They also talked about how comparable the Welsh bac was to other qualifications. Then they discussed the idea of universal adoption. Last but not least, they shared some opinions on the necessity of introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification.",

And I think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications\u00a0board, I think\u00a0the employers\u2014. And the only way we'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done. Because I think that's what the\u00a0vision was for the Welsh baccalaureate\u2014that it was going to improve skills for employment. But, somehow or other we've lost our way. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help.\nSpeaker: Ed Evans\nContent: I will carry on in English, if that's okay.\nSpeaker: Sian Gwenllian AM\nContent: Yes, it",

Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied?

I'll be asking my questions in Welsh.\nSpeaker: Dafydd Evans\nContent: Could I start and then open it up? Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru\u00a0would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac\u00a0there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. We've possibly chosen this panel because there are differences of opinion. So, I just want to give you that context at the outset. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac\u00a0means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac\u00a0is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I",
            " maybe, but that's what it should do.\nSpeaker: Julie Morgan AM\nContent: Right. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh bac, can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications? Because I know that Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there.\nSpeaker: Kay Martin\nContent: It probably depends on the subjects that\u00a0people are studying and the combination of subjects and the institution. Generally, in college, even if they're doing A-levels, they go out on some community projects or work-related education, without the Welsh bac\u2014even if they're not doing that. So, it does depend on the subject, I think.\nSpeaker: Dafydd Evans\nContent: I think there's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the Welsh bac\u00a0in terms of\u2014I don't think it's perfect by a long way, however, learners are getting some value out of that process.

Right, the next questions are from Julie Morgan.\nSpeaker: Julie Morgan AM\nContent: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that.\nSpeaker: Dafydd Evans\nContent: Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. Actually, it's probably larger than an A-level by now. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up",

We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden.\nSpeaker: Dawn Bowden AM\nContent: Thank you, Chair. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that?\nSpeaker: Dafydd Evans\nContent: I'm not assured in terms of\u2014yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside\u2014'Welsh bac\u00a0specialists' in inverted commas\u2014it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum.

And in that uh , regard , I thought we definitely w will need {disfmarker} it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings .

So .\nSpeaker: Grad B\nContent: another type of meeting .\nSpeaker: PhD C\nContent: Yeah .\nSpeaker: PhD F\nContent: Right .\nSpeaker: PhD C\nContent: But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think you need , uh , another portable thing a another portable equipment to {disfmarker} to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI .\nSpeaker: PhD F\nContent: Right .\nSpeaker: Grad B\nContent: Hmm .\nSpeaker: Professor D\nContent",

Uh , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ?

        "response": "The meeting was held by the Children, Young People and Education Committee in Wales. The committee was discussing their inquiry on education otherwise than at school, specifically focusing on the support for children with additional learning needs and those who are in Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) or Education Other Than At School (EOTAS) provision.\n\nThe committee heard from several witnesses, including Sharon Davies, Nick Williams, and David Hopkins, who represented various organizations, including the Association of Directors of Education in Wales and the Welsh Local Government Association.\n\nThe discussion centered around several key topics, including:\n\n1. The importance of inclusive schools and the need for schools to be aware of the impact of early trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on children's learning and well-being.\n2. The work being done on the ACEs agenda and the need for schools to adapt their practices to take account of this.\n3. The impact of the Gwent attachment team's work with PRUs in Gwent, which has been providing professional learning and support for staff.\n4. The need for collaborative working between schools, PRUs, and local authorities to ensure a continuum of provision and support for learners.\n5. The balance between funding being used for diagnosis and support, with concerns that funding tends to go into diagnosis rather than support.\n\nThe committee also discussed the need for a more qualitative and quantitative approach to understanding the experiences of children who move between different types of education provision, including PRUs and EOTAS.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the need for a more holistic and inclusive approach to supporting children with additional learning needs and those who are in PRUs or EOTAS provision, and for greater collaboration and coordination between different organizations and stakeholders.",
        "ground_truth": "The meeting was mainly about the reasons behind and the measurements against the increasing exclusions from school. The increase brought more pressure to EOTAS in the aspects of finance, transition, curriculum arrangement and the recruitment of professional staff. Although much time and finance had been devoted to the PRU, the education quality could still not be assured. The collaboration between the PRU and the schools required to be strengthened. Besides, training for special education ought to be included in teachers' colleges to meet EOTAS learners' special needs. Their psychological health was another concerning problem.",

I've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and Hefin David, and we've got no substitutions. Can I ask if Members have any declarations of interest? Can I just, then, declare for the record that I chair the cross-party group on suicide prevention and that Samaritans Cymru, who are appearing before us later, provide the secretariat for that group, just for that to be on the record? Item 2, then, is an evidence session for our inquiry on education otherwise than at school, and I'm very pleased to welcome our panel of witnesses this morning: Sharon Davies, head of learning, Torfaen County Borough Council and representing the Association of Directors of Education in Wales; Nick Williams, director of education, Swansea city and county council, and representing the Association of Directors of Education in Wales; and David Hopkins, interim head of education at the Welsh Local Government Association.

And, then, to what extent are schools aware of the impact of early trauma ACEs, and how are schools adapting their practices to take account of them?\nSpeaker: Dr Ian Johnson\nContent: I don't think we're really capable of saying that on an individual level. We're aware, as you've heard from previous evidence from heads of education, et cetera, directors of education, that work is going on on an all-Wales basis, and there's obviously an awful lot of work that's going on on the ACEs agenda. I referred to being a previous school governor, and that's somewhere that's become a trauma-informed school, and they have established that and are widening that base. I think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back, as I said, with the curriculum changes as we're",
            " we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what's happening. Would you agree with that?\nSpeaker: Sharon Davies\nContent: Yes, certainly.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Sharon, the CAMHS in-reach project is operational in Gwent,\u00a0but my understanding is that they don't include PRUs. Is that right?\nSpeaker: Sharon Davies\nContent: I don't know if that is the\u2014.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Okay, that's fine, that's my understanding. I just wanted to ask, then, the Gwent attachment team has been working with PRUs in Gwent, and the committee is familiar with the work of the Gwent attachment team, can you just tell us what you think the impact of that has been in terms of support for staff and embedding that awareness of attachment and early trauma in the PRUs?\nSpeaker: Sharon Davies\nContent: I think any form of professional learning, it's positive, and, therefore, as we alluded to earlier, it's that expertise training for the PRU then and for the staff there. It's having a positive impact. At the minute, I don't know what",
            " because they have to meet the challenge of the pupils, but the money is still in the schools, because it's once a year that they have that funding.\nSpeaker: Sian Hughes\nContent: Okay, thank you.\nSpeaker: Lynne Neagle AM\nContent: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: Thank you, Chair. What more can be done, and by whom, to support collaborative working between schools,\u00a0PRUs and local authorities to ensure that there is a continuum of provision and support for learners?\nSpeaker: Nick Williams\nContent: Well, one of the things I think that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector. We meet on a regular basis, and that's nationally. And the EOTAS group meets regionally as well. So, there's definitely a better sharing of practice. We put on some very, very good conferences as one form of professional learning. But it's also important\u2014. And we're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider, or it's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits, joint visits, to provision and also using",
            "Content: And, just finally, if that's okay, just to cross-refer the committee to the loneliness and isolation strategy, to which we made extensive representations on this issue. A part of the strategy talks about using our approach to accountability to recognise inclusive schools and reduce incentives to remove pupils from schools. So, that is a commitment in that strategy. It's a really important commitment to make a reality of that, because, actually, what is happening, I think, is that there are incentives that are perverse around this issue.\nSpeaker: Dr Ian Johnson\nContent: Could I just come in on that? I think there's an interesting, again, qualitative, quantitative, element to what happens to those children who move into PRU,\u00a0EOTAS provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career. So, I think there's a question, then, about\u2014I was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8, 8/9, et cetera, and how they loop back into the mainstream education system, what happens to them, but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into EOTAS, PRU",

Sarah's referred to the curriculum. I think there's a lot to be done, still, with regard to PRU and EOTAS with the new curriculum, and, hopefully, we'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on.\nSpeaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM\nContent: Thank you. And what are your views on the balance between funding being used for diagnosis and support, because I know that the Samaritans report suggested that funding tends to go into diagnosis rather than support? How can the balance be addressed?\nSpeaker: Liz Williams\nContent: I think it's a really difficult balance, but it was something that was brought up in the research stages of our report. So, we held a round table during the research period, and participants said that they were particularly concerned about the lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs.

The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects \u2014material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with LCD, applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation, and using low level chips, which was agreed by the group. The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel and the product should be technologically innovative.

Of course, conditions are required to ensure that the facility is available for operations, not for dividends or share buybacks, for example. We will impose conditions of that kind. We also want to make sure that we are aware of the situation the companies are in.

Canadian seniors are worried about COVID-19. In my own riding of Humber RiverBlack Creek, 30% of the population are 65 or older. We know they are one of the highest risk populations. During this time, their costs have gone up. They have had to spend extra on medication and grocery delivery, as many cannot leave their homes. I have also heard of many seniors who are facing extra dispensing fees. These costs all add up, and many seniors",

Next, the marketing suggested doing some product evaluation instead of just talking about it, so the group started to judge the design in three aspects: how fancy, technologically innovative, and easy-to-use the remote control was. It got three, two, and four in separate aspects, which meant the design was acceptable. Later, the group discussed the quotation and made some decisions on details of industrial design to make sure the cost was within the budget. Furthermore, they came up with some new ideas about future products, such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable TV that followed the trend and people's moods. Finally, the group named the product as pineapple remote control.",

After the financial targets, the team discussed the remote design. Despite the \"one-for-all\" style, the remote was still supposed to be user-friendly. Standard features such as sorting through channels and adjusting volume would not lose their priority. The team, therefore, agreed on a style of basic buttons with a self-intuitive screen menu.
